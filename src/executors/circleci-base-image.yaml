# src/executors/circleci-base-image.yaml

description: |
  The orb commands will use dockerized versions of terraform and the other orb capabilities.

  The executor used for these jobs should include any packages needed by your job configuration.
  Examples include tools for accessing secrets or referenced in job lifecycle hooks. Currently
  only linux based images are supported.

  The DPS circleci-base-image will be used by default.

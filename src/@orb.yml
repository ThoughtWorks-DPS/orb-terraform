  Managing Infrastructure and service configuration in a CircleCI pipeline using
  the twdps/terraform orb. An Infra Automation orb maintained by ThoughtWorks
  EMPC North America.

  NOTE: v1.0.0 is a breaking change. In addition to expanded analysis the static
  code analysis is a standalone job. While the prior major version supported
  separate static-analysis-only as a plan option, this a now a required
  pipeline format.
